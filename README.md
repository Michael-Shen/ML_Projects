# Machine Learning Projects Portfolio

## Overview
This repository showcases my **machine learning projects**, where I apply various ML algorithms to real-world problems. Each project includes **data preprocessing, model implementation, evaluation, and visualizations** to demonstrate my understanding of machine learning concepts.

## Projects
The projects are structured based on the **machine learning techniques** used:

### ðŸ¤– Supervised Learning  
- **[Linear Regression](Supervised_Learning/Linear_Regression.ipynb)** â€“ Predicting trends using regression models.  
- **[Logistic Regression](Supervised_Learning/Logistic_Regression.ipynb)** â€“ Binary classification for decision-making.  
- **[Random Forest](Supervised_Learning/Random_Forest.ipynb)** â€“ Ensemble learning for better accuracy.  

### ðŸ“ˆ Unsupervised Learning  
- **[K-Means Clustering](Clustering/Kmeans_Customer_Segmentation.ipynb)** â€“ Grouping customer data based on similarities.
- **[K-Means Clustering](Clustering/Kmeans_Heart_Disease.ipynb)** â€“ Grouping medical patients based on similarities. 
- **[PCA](Unsupervised_Learning/PCA_Dimensionality_Reduction.ipynb)** â€“ Dimensionality reduction for visualization.
- Anomaly Detection
- Recommender System

### ðŸ“Œ Deep Learning  
- **[Neural Networks](Deep_Learning/Neural_Networks_Basics.ipynb)** â€“ Fundamentals of deep learning with TensorFlow.  
- **[LSTM for Stock Prediction](Deep_Learning/LSTM_Stock_Prediction.ipynb)** â€“ Time-series forecasting using deep learning.  

## Technologies Used
- **Python** (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch)
